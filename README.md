## A Work Day Scheduler using Third Party APIs 
A daily work day planner that saves text inputs and also color codes by the hour depending on if the planner event is in the past, present or future as indicated by the colors: grey, red and green.



## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## My Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


## Steps I took to Build the app 
In HTML semantic tags have been used to aid with accessibility.
The site is built using Bootstrap as as a CSS framework.
The use of Bootstrap minimises the need for media queries.
See Bootstrap documentation for customizing the site with their provided options
Google Fonts allows for the usage of custom fonts that do not have to be installed on the user's machine
Font Awesome allows for the usage of custom icons
jQuery powers the dynamic rendering of the html content based on user input
moment.js is used to manipulate date values for historic data extraction from APIs
